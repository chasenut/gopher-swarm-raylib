# Gopher swarm

This is my first program in `raylib go` (and `go` itself), so I tried to make 
something at least some funny. More like little sandbox for learning.
Here it is, **thousands of Gophers bouncing** in a box. 
There is also perlin noise and hue color change, but it is more like
exploring possibilities of raylib.
I am aware that my collision system has some flaws, but it works for what it 
is supposed to do.

As I tested, I could get several tens of thousands of Gophers bouncing around 
running at stable 60 FPS.
    
## Run

```
go run main/main.go
```

## Manual (throw that away son, not gonna need it)

Move camera with `WASD` or arrow keys.
Spawn Gophers with `Q`.
